Notable exceptions to above:
structs not defined as typedef will be snake_case
typedef structs should be CamelCase, including first letter

Notable additions to above:
'private' struct members should be marked with an _ before the name:
 - "_private_member"
(not stated) methods should be snake_case, and verbs

include method prefixes based on usage
 - r_ : rendering methods
 - g_ : game methods
    - gm_ : map methods
    - ge_ : entity methods
    - gp_ : physics methods

Files:
filenames should be understandable- split files when possible (for different objects)
 - no filename prefix needed: unnecessary path length, filepath should explain context of the file.
shaders should be placed into folders named based on their usage. The 
actual filenames of the shaders should be simple: "vert.glsl", "frag.glsl", etc.
