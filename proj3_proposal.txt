My proposal for project 3 is to create a "shader gallery" program to showcase
various shader effects. Initially, I want to implement a set of shaders to 
showcase the differences between per-vertex phong shading and per-fragment
phong shading. After this, I want to try and implement a series of toon
shading effects. I plan to make these all accessible within the same program,
and showcased using different models that highlight the differences in each
effect. If I find that I have extra time, I want to make each 'piece' in the 
gallery interactive: allow the camera to orbit, add UI to control parameters
in the shaders, etc.
