# CS441 Final project.
This is my final project for my Intro to Computer Graphics course at the University of Oregon.
The goal of this project was to create a basic shader gallery to showcase various effects in an interactive, compact application.

# Libraries used:
 - OpenGL
 - GLFW3
 - GLM
 - ASSIMP
 - STBImage
 - Dear ImGui
# Build/run instructions
I tried to make this project simple to build and run, and included a simple bash script to run all of the commands for setup in as simple a way as possible. I developed this on Ubuntu 22.04, and only tested it on Linux. I cannot guarantee the libraries will be included properly for mac. To build and run the program, simply clone the repo into a folder and run the build.sh script. The executable will be placed into {folder}/build/bin, alongside all of the resources necessary to run it.
